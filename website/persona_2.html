        <h2>Sarah, The Communicator</h2>
        <p>Sarah, age 21, is a college student studying communications. She isnâ€™t particularly structured with her finances and usually manages her money through a basic banking app. She finds it challenging to set long-term savings goals, often getting distracted by short-term wants.</p>
        <p>Sarah is interested in social features and community challenges that encourage saving, as they appeal to her Gen Z social mentality. She would benefit from an app that provides weekly spending insights, automatically tracks expenses, and offers cumulative reports. Sarah values financial awareness, but she needs motivation and encouragement to stick to her budget.</p>
