        <h2>Michael, The Independent Wealth Manager</h2>
        <p>Michael, age 25, works full-time as an analyst and has a strong understanding of finances. He doesn’t currently use any financial apps, as he relies on a personal accountant and custom budgeting spreadsheets. Michael’s financial priorities are focused on comparing current and past rates to optimize his savings strategy.</p>
        <p>Although he doesn’t need spending alerts, he finds savings advice valuable. Michael prefers advanced tools over simplicity, as he is tech-savvy and manages a substantial amount of money. His main concerns are security and privacy, and he would benefit from a manual data input feature in a finance app that allows him to track his financial goals in a straightforward, secure way.</p>
