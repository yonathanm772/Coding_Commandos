        <h2>Jordan, The Social Spender</h2>
        <p>Jordan, age 20, is a sophomore who enjoys spending time with friends and occasionally overspends on social activities. He keeps an eye on his finances through his bank and credit card apps but feels he lacks control over his spending habits.</p>
        <p>Jordan would appreciate weekly budgeting insights, clear breakdowns of spending categories, and reminders to stay within his budget. His ideal app would have a smooth, easy-to-navigate interface with spending alerts to help him stay mindful of his spending limits. Privacy is also important to him, and he needs a finance app that makes tracking expenses simple and personalized to his needs.</p>
