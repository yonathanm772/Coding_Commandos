        <h2>Alex, The Planner</h2>
        <p>Alex, age 23, is a full-time student and part-time intern in finance. He is highly organized and likes to divide his monthly income, keeping 60% for savings and 40% for spending. Alex uses spreadsheets and financial tracking apps to manage his finances but struggles with unexpected expenses that throw his budget off. He values privacy and data security in any app he uses.</p>
        <p>For Alex, an ideal finance app would offer monthly spending reviews, a simple and intuitive interface, and visual tools like pie charts to categorize expenses clearly. Alex is very interested in financial literacy and aims to maintain strict control over his finances.</p>
