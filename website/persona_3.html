        <h2>David, The Freshman</h2>
        <p>David, age 19, is a freshman in college who relies on financial support from his parents. He doesn’t have a steady income and primarily uses his banking app to check his balance. One of David’s main challenges is managing currency exchange rates, as he frequently transfers money between American and Canadian accounts.</p>
        <p>He’s interested in receiving spending alerts and gentle financial advice but prefers to avoid community features, as he sees his finances as a private matter. David values security in financial apps, as he is cautious about sharing his data, and would find automated tracking and basic financial education useful to help him gain more independence.</p>
