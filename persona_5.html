        <h2>Taylor, The Transitioning Adult</h2>
        <p>Taylor, age 22, is a college senior preparing to transition into full adulthood, juggling school and a part-time retail job. She is becoming increasingly conscious of her finances but finds it challenging to separate wants from needs and plan for the future.</p>
        <p>Taylor uses her banking app for basic monitoring but is interested in features like currency exchange, monthly spending reviews, and savings advice. For her, a finance app with advanced tools but a user-friendly interface would be ideal, as she wants guidance on planning for the future but doesnâ€™t want an overcomplicated setup. Taylor sees value in occasional financial advice, especially regarding investments.</p>
